### React Query
React Query is a state management library that simplifies the process of fetching, caching, and updating data in React applications. Its major benefits include automatic background refetching, caching and stale data management, error handling, and easy pagination and infinite scrolling. Compared to setting up requests with useEffect, React Query provides a more declarative and centralized approach to managing data in React, which results in cleaner and more efficient code. It also reduces boilerplate code and improves performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders and network requests.
